## Prerequisites:

The following hardware is required to use this software:

* 3 Raspberry Pis (Can be any version of RPi, but for best results use a RPi2 or RPi3 as the database and web server and one as the master)  
My configuration is:
 - RPi 3 for database
 - RPi 2 as master
 - RPi 0 as slave
* A decently powerful linux server used to transcode the video streamed from the RPi 2 if you want to run this 24/7  
The linux server is only necessary if you wish to stream to an online service such as ustream.tv
* RPi SenseHat
* RPi Camera Module
* USB Microphone
For best results use a Omni microphone such as this [https://www.amazon.com/CAD-Audio-U9-Condenser-Microphone/dp/B004P1BQG2](U9 Mini Microphone)
* ATMega328-PU
* A waterproof temperature sensor
I use a DS18B20 and built a voltage divider to measure the resistance and calculate the temperature
* Wires, components, breadboards and such that will be necessary to connect everything


## Installation:

In the future an SD card image will be available to download

To build the software yourself, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
